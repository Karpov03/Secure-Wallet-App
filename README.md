## Why this tool

This project gives a concise numeric score and a breakdown for any crypto wallet address. It targets traders, auditors, bot builders, and passive income researchers who need a fast risk check before interaction or listing.

The score helps:
- Spot wash trading or circular flows.
- Find mixing service links.
- Flag sudden token dumps or suspicious airdrop receipts.
- Feed checks into arbitrage or trading bots.

## Key features

- Single address scoring with a numeric risk value (0â€“100).
- Pattern detection: mixers, dusting, contract-interaction spikes.
- Heuristics for on-chain signs of scams or rug pulls.
- CSV and JSON export for bulk analysis.
- Lightweight CLI for automation.
- API endpoints for integration with bots and dashboards.

## How it works

1. The checker fetches transaction history and on-chain metadata.
2. It computes metrics: in/out flow, token concentration, counterparty count, and known-blacklist hits.
3. It applies heuristics and weights to produce a final score.
4. The tool returns a score, a color code, and a compact breakdown of contributing factors.

The engine uses on-chain data sources and optional third-party feeds for known malicious addresses. You can attach a custom blacklist for internal checks.

## Usage examples

Single address check (CLI)
```bash
# Check an address and print JSON
./secure-wallet-app check 0x1234abcd... --format json
```

Bulk check from CSV
```bash
./secure-wallet-app bulk --input wallets.csv --output results.csv
```

HTTP API example (local server)
```bash
# Start the service
./secure-wallet-app server --port 8080

# Query via curl
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/check \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"address":"0x1234abcd...","chain":"ethereum"}'
```

Response (JSON)
```json
{
  "address": "0x1234abcd...",
  "score": 28,
  "color": "red",
  "reasons": [
    {"type":"mixer_link","scoreImpact":-30,"details":"High probability of mixing"},
    {"type":"high_outflow","scoreImpact":-10,"details":"Large single-day outflow"}
  ],
  "metrics": {
    "txCount": 512,
    "uniqueCounterparties": 42,
    "tokenConcentration": 0.78
  }
}
```

## Score breakdown

The score ranges from 0 (highest risk) to 100 (lowest risk). The tool computes sub-scores from:

- On-chain flow (in/out ratios)
- Counterparty diversity
- Token concentration per address
- Interaction with flagged addresses
- Timing patterns (e.g., bursts)
- Contract vs. EOA behavior

Each factor adds or subtracts points. The response includes the main drivers so you can make automated decisions.

Color mapping:
- 0â€“30: red (high risk)
- 31â€“55: orange (medium risk)
- 56â€“80: yellow (low risk)
- 81â€“100: green (safe)

## CLI & API

CLI flags
- check <address> : single-address score
- bulk --input <file> --output <file> : batch
- server --port <n> : run HTTP server
- --format json|csv|text : output format
- --chain ethereum|bsc|polygon : chain selector
- --blacklist <file> : add a custom blacklist

API endpoints
- POST /api/v1/check â€” request JSON payload with address and chain
- POST /api/v1/bulk â€” upload CSV
- GET /api/v1/status â€” health and version

Authentication
- The server supports API keys. Configure via env var or config file.

## Integration patterns

- Pre-trade check: call the API inside your trade execution pipeline. Block trades if score < threshold.
- Listing filter: bulk-scan addresses before listing tokens or pools.
- Monitoring: schedule periodic re-checks for high-value addresses and alert on large score changes.
- Data pipeline: export JSON to S3 and feed into analytics.

Example: connect to a trading bot
1. Bot requests score for counterparty.
2. If score < 40, bot aborts or downgrades exposure size.
3. Log the decision with scoring details.

## Configuration

Configuration hierarchy:
1. Command-line flags
2. Environment variables
3. config.yaml in the working directory

Sample config.yaml
```yaml
server:
  port: 8080
data:
  cache_ttl_seconds: 3600
chains:
  ethereum:
    rpc: https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY
blacklist: ./blacklist.txt
thresholds:
  block_trade: 40
  warn: 60
```

Blacklists
- Provide a newline-delimited file of known bad addresses.
- The tool combines the built-in blacklist with your file.

Caching
- The app caches on-chain queries for the TTL. Set TTL low for fresh checks, high for bulk runs.

## Security model

- The app runs read-only queries to blockchains and third-party feeds.
- It never holds private keys.
- It supports running in an isolated environment or inside containers.
- Use HTTPS for server mode in production and enforce API keys.

Best practices
- Run the service behind a reverse proxy.
- Limit API keys to specific IPs where possible.
- Rotate keys for third-party RPC providers.

## Testing & QA

- Unit tests cover scoring heuristics and parsers.
- Integration tests run against testnets or recorded fixtures.
- CI runs static analysis and test suites on pull requests.

Run tests locally:
```bash
./secure-wallet-app test
```
